<h2>Ingredient Checklist</h2>
<ol>
   <li> 1 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
  <li>  ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
   <li> ⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
  <li>  ¼ teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
   <li> 3 cups unsweetened almond milk</li>
   <li> 1 teaspoon butter (Optional)</li>
   <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (Optional)</li>
</ol>
   

<h2> Directions </h2>


   <h3> Step 1 </h3>

    <p>Pour honey into a deep saucepan over medium heat. Boil until a shade darker and caramel-like in aroma, about 10 minutes. Turn off heat and whisk in cold water.
    </p>
    <h3> Step 2 </h3>

   <p>
      Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat (such as Silpat®). Place a mixing bowl and a whisk in the refrigerator.
   </p>

    <h3> Step 3 </h3>
     <p>
    Place a large metal bowl over the lowest heat setting on the stovetop. Add butter, sugar, 1/4 cup of the burnt honey, and regular wildflower honey. Let sit until butter melts, 5 to 7 minutes.
   </p>

     <h3> Step 4 </h3>
     <p>
   Meanwhile, combine baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a small bowl.
   </p>

     <h3> Step 5 </h3>
     <p>
   Whisk butter mixture and let sit until very warm to the touch. Whisk in eggs. Keep mixture over low heat until it gets very warm again; whisk in baking soda mixture. Remove from heat. Sift in flour in 2 or 3 additions, stirring well after each, until batter is easily spreadable.
   </p>

     <h3> Step 6 </h3>
     <p>
    Transfer about 1/2 cup batter onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread into an 8- or 9-inch circle using an offset spatula. Shake and tap the pan to knock out any air bubbles.
   </p>

     <h3> Step 7 </h3>
     <p>
   Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove liner from the pan and let cake layer continue cooling until firm enough to remove, 6 to 7 minutes. Invert cake onto a round of parchment paper.
   </p>

     <h3> Step 8 </h3>
     <p>
   Repeat until you have a total of 8 cake layers, letting each cool on an individual parchment round. Trim edges using a pizza wheel to ensure they are the same size; save scraps for crumb mixture.
   </p>

     <h3> Step 9 </h3>
     <p>
    Spread remaining batter onto the lined baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are dry, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cut into small pieces; toss with reserved cake scraps.
   </p>
